# Voyager Hub (Lite)
A hub **full with features** and **optimized** for the **best experience!** Most of the code are **open source!** (feel free to use) but some are obfuscated for security and performance reasons. The repository is the **base** of Voyager, serving as the structure of the hub.

*Full will be added soon.*
